[How tech companies are trying to make augmented and virtual reality a thing, again](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/11/21121275/augmented-virtual-reality-hiring-software-engineers-hired)

## Comment
This article is about how tech companies have been investing in virtual and augmented reality and hiring software engineers who can code in AR/VR. I found the term “effortless AR” mentioned in the article very interesting. So far, most popular AR products such as Pokémon GO are app-centric, meaning that users must log in to some smartphone app in order to experience the AR technology. How to integrate the AR technology into everyday life seamlessly without any effort is an issue yet to be resolved.

According to the article, there has been a 1,400% growth in company interview demand for AR/VR engineers, which I found quite surprising. The article also mentions the role of education in this time of explosive growth. From what I've observed, it doesn't seem like AR/VR related courses are offered on a regular basis here at NYU (I was planning to take the Programming for Mobile VR course offered by the CS department last summer, but unfortunately it got canceled). Given the fast-growing demand, it would be nice if schools can teach students how to code in AR/VR.

With VR growing so fast in recent years, including headsets quickly moving from requiring cameras all around the room and wires everywhere to just the headset with wirelss connectivity, it's not too surprising that the demand for software engineers is increasing, but the rate at which requests are increasing is still pretty amazing.

omg hi! i relate to your interest about AR/VR because it has also been something that i am pursuing. have you checked out the interactive computing course (cas) or the game design department at tisch (370 jay street) i know they have a bunch of AR courses!
creative coding is something that i am moving towards, and it's really great to hear that there has been a growth for AR/VR engineers (although to be honest i've not heard of the term engineers to describe people who do VR)...or it's just not as common in the CS department in school.
i also really like the idea of "effortless AR" or "everyday AR" and i think there seem to be more apps for consumers to be exposed to and even create their own elements and projects, but it hasn't really caught up yet.

VR is a a new way of entertainment, but how to bring VR to people's everyday life and how to play VR games as we play games on smartphone or computer still have a long way to go.
