[How tech companies are trying to make augmented and virtual reality a thing, again](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/11/21121275/augmented-virtual-reality-hiring-software-engineers-hired)

## Comment
This article is about how tech companies have been investing in virtual and augmented reality and hiring software engineers who can code in AR/VR. I found the term “effortless AR” mentioned in the article very interesting. So far, most popular AR products such as Pokémon GO are app-centric, meaning that users must log in to some smartphone app in order to experience the AR technology. How to integrate the AR technology into everyday life seamlessly without any effort is an issue yet to be resolved.

According to the article, there has been a 1,400% growth in company interview demand for AR/VR engineers, which I found quite surprising. The article also mentions the role of education in this time of explosive growth. From what I've observed, it doesn't seem like AR/VR related courses are offered on a regular basis here at NYU (I was planning to take the Programming for Mobile VR course offered by the CS department last summer, but unfortunately it got canceled). Given the fast-growing demand, it would be nice if schools can teach students how to code in AR/VR.
